# UltraMagnet

**UltraMagnet** is a Unity mod/plugin built using BepInEx and Harmony. It transforms the in-game magnet mechanics by adding an ultra-strong magnetic field that affects various game objects such as coins, cannonballs, projectiles, grenades, and more. Customizable via PluginConfigurator, UltraMagnet allows you to fine-tune the magnet's properties and behavior to suit your gameplay.

## Features

- **Radius of magnets:** Enhances the magnet effect to dramatically pull in nearby objects.
- **Configurable Options:** Adjust properties like magnet radius, spinning force, and more.
- **Multiple Patches:**
  - **Cannonball Patch:** Modifies how cannonballs are affected.
  - **Coin Patch:** Controls coin attraction and collection behavior.
  - **Projectile Patch:** Alters projectile dynamics with magnetism.
  - **Harpoon & Grenade Patches:** Offer additional customization for specific game objects.
- **Seamless Integration:** Works with BepInEx and uses Harmony to patch game behavior at runtime.
